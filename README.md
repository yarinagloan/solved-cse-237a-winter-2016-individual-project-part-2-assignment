In this part, you will implement a program which interacts with the RPi2’s sensors. The RPi2 provides multiple General Purpose Input/Output ( GPIO) connectors, which carry signals to/from the sensors. You will connect the sensors to the RPi2, and implement a user space program using the WiringPi library for GPIO communications. The program you will create emulates a sensor platform that detects emergency situations in operating vehicles.Subsequently, you will use the base code that extends sensors with longer latencies, on which you will implement an Energy­efficient EDF scheduler.

<strong>Complete the following steps:</strong>

<ol>

 <li>Familiarize yourself with WiringPI:<u> http://wiringpi.com/</u></li>

 <li>Implement a sensor interaction program based on skeleton code available at:</li>

</ol>

<ol start="3">

 <li>Update your sensor interaction program, which now includes latencies, to implement an earliest­deadline­first ( EDF) scheduler.</li>

 <li>Implement an energy­efficient EDF scheduler for your application</li>

</ol>

­ The scheduler should manage the workloads available at: <a href="http://seelab.ucsd.edu/cse237a_wi16">http://seelab.ucsd.edu/cse237a_wi16</a>
